Other tests that could be run after adding the movie.
1. Validate that there is a search feature  for movies in the system and make sure that the movie has been saved.
	.Positive test to validate saved movies exist.
	.Negative test to validate that any movies that had any invalid data were not saved to database.
2. Perform a database test to validate that the movies were added with all of the appropriate information.
3. Perform a test where one of the movies is deleted from the database and then validate that it doesn't appear in the video section.
3. I would go back and write a test to perform positive and negative login tests using alphanumeric characters as well as valid and invalid credentials.
